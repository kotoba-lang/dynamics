Its value comes from a use nobody else supplies at all, not from a claim on cash flow. The design lesson for a compute network is uncomfortable but specific: the accrual mechanism is a multiplier on demand, never a substitute for it, and a monopoly on a real use outperforms a well-engineered sink on a commodity use.

The structural parallel is direct and worth stating: a design that pays its suppliers out of user fees has, by that same act, decided its token is not the residual claimant. Note also the separately-measured $20.4M of Uniswap Labs interface fees: when a protocol declines to charge at the protocol layer, the operating company can still charge at the interface layer, and that revenue belongs to the company, not the holders.

  "Structural strength AND realized annual flow, reported as two axes that are
   deliberately NOT collapsed into one score.

   Why this exists (added 2026-07-25 alongside the incumbent money-system
   comparators): `loop-structural-strength` answers exactly one question --
   how fast does this loop compound -- and its value is dominated by
   cycles-per-year. Ranked on that axis alone, a 12-second Ethereum slot beats
   a quarterly bank capital cycle by ~5 orders of magnitude, which is a true
   statement about compounding speed and a badly false one about which system
   issues most of the world's money. Any reader who takes the one-axis ranking
   as 'which system is bigger/stronger' is being misled by the model, so the
   model now reports the second axis rather than relying on the reader to
   remember the caveat.

   Flow figures are NOT comparable across kinds. :annual-flow-usd in this
   catalog has always mixed gross volume settled (Visa's $17T), fees collected
   (Ethereum's $2.73B), operator revenue and total market size -- a latent unit
   inconsistency that predates this function. Rather than silently rank across
   them, entries are grouped by :flow-kind, and every entry that has a flow
   figure but no declared kind lands in :unclassified-flow-kind, where it is
   reported and not ranked. Adding :flow-kind to those entries is the fix; this
   function makes the gap visible instead of averaging over it.

   :speed-vs-scale-correlation is a Spearman rank correlation between strength
   and flow, computed SEPARATELY WITHIN each flow-kind that has at least 3
   entries -- deliberately not pooled across kinds, since pooling would be the
   exact cross-unit ranking this function exists to refuse. Values far from
   +/-1 mean speed does not predict scale within that kind, i.e. the two axes
   carry independent information and collapsing them would lose some. Computed,
   not assumed; with n=5 per kind these are directional, not conclusive."
