  "Real stock-and-flow simulation via kotoba-lang/org-oasis-open-xmile (OASIS
   XMILE 1.0), for the loops this namespace's own `loop-structural-strength`
   can only score as a single point-in-time number.

   This namespace exists to correct a real gap: `org-oasis-open-xmile` was
   already ADR-authoritative for system-dynamics computation in kotoba-lang
   (ADR-2607072350, 2026-07-07) when `dynamics.core` was built (ADR-2607203000,
   2026-07-20) -- `dynamics.core`'s own hand-rolled `stock`/`flow`/`loop*`
   constructors and `loop-structural-strength` formula duplicate ground a
   real, standards-compliant, already-simulating engine already covered, more
   rigorously. `loop-structural-strength` stays (it answers a different
   question cheaply -- 'which of N archetypes compounds fastest, given only
   4 coarse parameters' -- without needing a full equation model for each
   one), but any caller who wants an actual projected TRAJECTORY, not a
   single comparative score, should reach for this namespace instead of
   inventing another one-off simulator.

   Callers MUST require `org-oasis-open-xmile`'s own `xmile.model`/
   `xmile.validate`/`xmile.execute` on their classpath (this namespace is a
   thin, honest convenience layer over them, not a reimplementation -- it
   takes an already-built `xmile-model-ns` map of those 3 namespaces' public
   fns, the same 'host injects its dependencies' pattern org-oasis-open-xmile
   itself uses for XML parsing, so this namespace has zero hard dependency
   edge of its own).")

   acquisition-funnel shape this catalog keeps re-deriving by hand: a
   constant real inflow rate (e.g. daily visitors), a constant conversion
   rate (e.g. a measured or upper-bound-estimated F2), feeding a single
   accumulating stock from a real starting value.

   This is deliberately NOT a network-effect/feedback model (the stock does
   not feed back into the inflow rate) -- adding a self-reinforcing term
   would require a real measured coefficient this catalog has never
   observed (the whole point of the F2-upper-bound finding is that F2 has
   NEVER fired), and fabricating one would violate this whole workspace's
   'never fabricate' discipline. Callers who want to explore a
   feedback/network-effect SCENARIO should build one explicitly and label
   it as a scenario, not ship it as this fn's default.
